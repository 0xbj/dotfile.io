Using the voltages tab you can easily set up your new voltages for linux-PHC.<br>
You can set the values as VIDs (Voltage IDentification numbers) using the SpinButton boxes.<br>
The range of values you can select is between "0" as the lowest one and the processors standart VID as highest one.<br>
<br>
Below those SpinButtons you'll see the calculated voltage (if calculation is available).<br>
Below that you'll see the calculated difference between your new value and the processors default value.<br>
The voltages are automatically updated if you change the VID. The voltage boxes are read-only.<br><br>
If voltage calculation is not available for your CPU you'll just don't see any voltage values but the SpinButtons
will work.<br><br>
