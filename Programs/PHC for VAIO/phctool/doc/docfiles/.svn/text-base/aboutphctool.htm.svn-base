PHCtool is a GUI for linux-PHC. It is written in Python and is using the GTK widgets.
<br>
PHCtool has been created to make linux-phc easier to users.
<br><br>
The developer says:<br>
<i>"As I first stumbled about linux-phc I really liked it. After setting it up and comparing the
differences I decided to stay with this project.<br>
In those early days I started writing some documentations. By doing that I learned that it would be 
very useful if there is a GUI to set up and display the values.
Thats why I started wrtiting the first lines of code.
