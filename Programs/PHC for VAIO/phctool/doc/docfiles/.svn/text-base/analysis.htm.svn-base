By using linux-phc you can not be sure if the values you set up really are used by the processor.<br>
This may have many reasons and you can not force anything.<br>
To check what VIDs currently REALLY are used you can use this analsysis tab.<br>
<br>
You'll have to load the kernel module "msr" first (#modprobe msr).<br>
After that just click the "Refresh"-Button. The values displayed are valid for the frequency step your processor currently is in.
<br><br>
To check it for other frequencies just force a frequency. You can use Gnome's "CPU Frequency Scaling Monitor" appet or what ever you like.
