PHCtool brings a simple installation script. This script is doing the following things:

<ul class="ulbull">
<li>create a new group using groupadd</li>
<li>adding this group to /etc/sudoers</li>
<li>setting permissions to the PHCTool files</li>
</ul>

You'll be asked for each task if you want the installer to perform it.<br>
If you don't wish to use the installer or if the installer doesn't work for you (in that case please contact me) 
you can start PHCTool by calling phctool.sh as root.<br>
PHCTool needs to be started as root because the SysFS Interface of acpi and linux-phc are writable by root only.<br>
<br>
To install PHCTool using the installer;
<ul class="ulbull">
<li>Copy all files to the location you want to store it</li>
<li>Run install.sh as root within a command line</li>
<li>Follow the installers instructions</li>
</ul>
After finishing the installer you have to
<ul class="ulbull">
<li>add each user who can use PHCTool to the new group (installer default: 'phctool')</li>
<li>logout and re-login to have the group changes take effect.</li>
</ul>
