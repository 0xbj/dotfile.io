The author of PHCTool is Colin Michael.<br>
He is an IT Specialist with special interest in computer security.<br>
<br>
Colin started writing PHCTool shortly after stumbling about linux-phc.<br>
He wished to have an easy GUI to set up linux-phc values and a tool that automatically reloads the values on reboot.<br>
<br><br>
Colin wants to say "Thank You" to all people helping with PHCTool, finding bugs, translation errors and what ever else.<br>
Special thanks goes to Whoopie. He diggs deep in the code to find errors and is giving good advices.
