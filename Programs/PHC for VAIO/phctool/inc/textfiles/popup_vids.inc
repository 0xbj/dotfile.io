Using this tab you can set up new VIDs for your CPU.
VID means Voltage Identifier and is some kind of system voltage multiplier.
Normally each speed step uses a certain VID.
Notice that some CPUs (Intel Core, etc) have a limitation preventing you from setting lower voltages than the lowest standard one.
